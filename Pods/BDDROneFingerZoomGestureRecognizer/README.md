# BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer

## Description

`UIGestureRecognizer` subclass to enable one-finger-zoom gestures.

This concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer` enables one-finger-zooming ([like in the Google Maps iOS app](http://littlebigdetails.com/post/51559128905/)). It has support for elastic bouncing, like `UIScrollView` does:

If you're going to use this with `UIScrollView` or want to see it in action make sure to check out [BDDRScrollViewAdditions](https://github.com/bddckr/BDDRScrollViewAdditions).

## Installation

Simply add the files in the `BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer.h` and `BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer.m` to your project or add `BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer` to your Podfile if you're using CocoaPods.

## Customization

There are several properties that change the default behavior, especially interesting are `numberOfTapsRequired`, `minimumPressDuration` and `allowableMovement`. For more info see the [header](https://github.com/bddckr/BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer/blob/master/BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer/BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer.h).
